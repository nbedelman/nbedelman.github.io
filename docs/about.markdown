## Nathaniel Edelman, PhD

I am currently a Hutchinson Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies](https://yibs.yale.edu/). I spend my work time thinking about the interplay between local adaptation and gene flow in determining evolutionary outcomes. I'm particularly interested in this interaction in the context of climate change, and am focusing on the effect that genetic architecture of traits has on the dynamics of rapid evolution. I am an equal opportunity organismal scientist, having worked on fruit flies as an undergraduate, pigeons as a lab technician, butterflies as a PhD, and now frogs a as a postdoc!
