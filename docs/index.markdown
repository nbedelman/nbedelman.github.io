				<p>What happens when populations of organisms diverge and adapt to their local conditions, but then those conditions change? Can they hybridize, combining the bits and pieces of each group that are best suited to the new normal, or are they too far gone, with each left to fend for itself? What factors influence which path a given set of populations will take, and which groups of organisms are more likely to take each one? I try to answer these questions through eco-evolutionary modeling and comparative genomics, and think about what the results mean for species that must respond to climate change. </p>
